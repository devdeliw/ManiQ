### ManiQ 

I'm working on an animation engine to animate quantum circuits shadowing off
Grant Sanderson's incredible animation library
[Manim](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=manim&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8).

ManiQ will be equipped with interactivity -- allowing users to build their own
quantum circuits and visualize them executing in an aesthetic manner. 

I hope to add features to allow users to visualize a statevector's evolution
*as* the circuit runs for educational purposes. In addition, I'll add features
to visualize measurement probabilities, density matrix(es) updating in real
time, entanglement and much more. 

Thank you for checking this project out. Once it gets up and running I'll make
it open source.
